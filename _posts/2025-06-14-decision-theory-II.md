<h2 id="decision-trees-strengths-limitations">Strengths and Limitations of Decision Trees</h2>

Decision trees provide a straightforward way to model decisions under uncertainty. Each path from start to finish shows a sequence of choices and events that lead to a specific outcome. The left-to-right layout makes the timing of decisions and chance events visually clear, helping to avoid confusion about what is known at each point. 

For small problems with only a few stages, decision trees can be evaluated using basic arithmetic. This simplicity makes them accessible to a wide audience, including those without technical training. They serve as effective tools for teaching, storytelling, and supporting real-world decisions. 

Yet this intuitive structure comes with notable drawbacks. One issue is the risk of combinatorial explosion. Another limitation is that decision trees do not explicitly show conditional independencies.

<h3 id="combinatorial-explosion">Combinatorial Explosion</h3>
The memory required to store a decision tree and the time required to process it both **increase
exponentially** with the number of variables and their possible states, whether they are decisions or
probabilistic outcomes. In a symmetric problem with $$n$$ variables, each having $$k$$ possible outcomes, you face $$k^{n}$$ distinct paths. Since a decision tree represents all scenarios explicitly, a problem with 50 binary variables would yield an impractical $$2^{50}$$ paths (<a href="https://pshenoy.ku.edu/Papers/EOLSS09.pdf"><u>Shenoy, 2009</u></a>).

The number of decision paths is profoundly affected by the order and meaning of the variables (i.e., the problem's definition). In our original oil field investment problem from <a href="https://ferjorosa.github.io/blog/2025/06/08/decision-theory-I.html"><u>Part I</u></a>, the options <span style="color:red;">Do not perform test</span> and <span style="color:red;">Do not buy</span> prune the tree, resulting in 12 distinct decision paths. This is an *asymmetric* problem structure:

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" align="center">
      <i><b>Figure 1.</b> Decision tree diagram of the asymmetric oil field investment problem from Part I.</i>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

Conversely, a problem with the same types of variables, but structured *symmetrically*, would yield significantly more paths. For instance, imagine the company must always choose to either <span style="color:red;">Invest in Field A</span> or <span style="color:red;">Invest in Field B</span>. Both fields then undergo a geological test (say, <span style="color:red;">Test X</span> or <span style="color:red;">Test Y</span>, each with different costs and accuracy profiles), followed by the actual drilling revealing the field's quality. This structure forces every path to be fully explored, doubling the number of distinct paths from 12 to 24:

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="/assets/2025-06-14-decision-theory-II/oil_symmetric_tree_annotated.png" alt="Decision tree diagram of a hypothetical symmetric oil problem" height="200">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" align="center">
      <i><b>Figure 2.</b> Decision tree diagram of a hypothetical symmetric oil field investment problem.</i>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

Even this revised example demonstrates how swiftly a decision tree can escalate beyond practical use. For instance, merely replacing the three-level oil quality (high/medium/low) with a more granular five-level scale (excellent/good/average/poor/dry) would push the total from 24 to 40 terminal nodes. This occurs without even considering longer time horizons, dynamic market-price scenarios, or additional complex choices.

This **combinatorial explosion** not only affects computational tractability but, even at more modest levels, severely compromises interpretability. As a rule of thumb, once a tree approaches about 100 terminal nodes, it loses its key strength: easy readability and intuitive understanding.


<h3 id="hidden-independence">Hidden Conditional Independencies</h3>

In addition to the issue of combinatorial explosion, decision trees have another important limitation: they assume a strict, linear chain of dependence. In a decision tree, every variable is implicitly conditioned on *all* previous events along its particular path. This rigid structure prevents us from explicitly representing one of the most important concepts in probabilistic modeling: <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence"><u>conditional independence</u></a></b>.

To illustrate this, consider a generic problem with four <span style="color:purple;"><b>random variables</b></span>: $$A$$ and $$B$$ (each with two possible states, $$a_1, a_2$$ and $$b_1, b_2$$, respectively), and $$C$$ and $$D$$ (each with three possible states, $$c_1, c_2, c_3$$ and $$d_1, d_2, d_3$$). In a traditional decision tree, where conditional independencies cannot be explicitly represented, you must specify the entire joint probability distribution for all variables. This means assigning a probability to every possible combination of outcomes, as shown in the joint probability table below:

**Total distinct probabilities:** $$ 2 \; (\text{for } A) \times 2 \; (\text{for } B) \times 3 \; (\text{for } C) \times 3 \; (\text{for } D) = \mathbf{36} $$.

<div style="background-color: #e0f7fa; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  This example demonstrates conditional independencies using a simplified version of a decision tree, where all nodes are probabilistic (often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_diagram_(probability_theory)"><u>probability tree</u></a>). However, the core concepts and benefits of explicit representation apply equally to the chance nodes within any general decision tree.
</div>
<br>

Now, let's say that conditional independencies do exist in this problem. For instance, let's say that $$B$$ is conditionally independent of $$C$$ and $$D$$ given $$A$$. We denote that statement by $$(B \bot \{C, D\} \mid A)$$. In that case:

$$
P(B \mid A, C, D) = P(B \mid A)
$$

This fundamental concept allows us to represent relationships far more efficiently. Consider Figure 3, which implies the following conditional independence statements:
* &nbsp;$$ (B \bot \{C, D\} \mid A)$$
* &nbsp;$$ (C \bot B \mid A)$$
* &nbsp;$$ (D \bot \{A,B\} \mid C)$$

The diagram corresponds to the directed acyclic graph of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network"><u>Bayesian network</u></a>, which visually encodes these independencies: arrows indicate direct probabilistic influence, while the absence of an arrow between two nodes reflects a conditional independence given their parents.

</center>

When these conditional independencies are recognized and modeled, we no longer need to construct a single large joint probability table. Instead, the full joint probability distribution can be factored into a product of smaller, more manageable conditional probability tables. In our example, this means we only need to specify:

* &nbsp;$$ P(A) \rightarrow 2 = 2 $$ entries
* &nbsp;$$ P(B \mid A) \rightarrow 2 \cdot 2 = 4 $$ entries  
* &nbsp;$$ P(C \mid A) \rightarrow 2 \cdot 3 = 6 $$ entries
* &nbsp;$$ P(D \mid C) \rightarrow 3 \cdot 3 = 9 $$ entries

**Total distinct probabilities:** $$2 + 4 + 6 + 9 = \mathbf{21}$$.

This represents a dramatic decrease from the 36 entries required in the full joint probability table. By reducing the number of parameters that must be specified, the model becomes much more manageable, transparent, and easier to modify. As decision problems increase in complexity, the advantages of explicitly modeling conditional independencies grow even more significant.

<h3 id="formal_definition">Formal Definition</h3>


A **decision network** (<a href=""><u>Howard & Matheson, 1984</u></a>), also known as an **influence diagram** is a directed acyclic graph represented as $$G = (N, E)$$, where:

The set of nodes $$N$$ is partitioned into three subsets:

* <span style="color:red;"><b>Decision nodes</b></span>: Shown as squares, these indicate points where the decision-maker selects among available actions.
* <span style="color:purple;"><b>Chance nodes</b></span>: Depicted as circles, these capture uncertain factors or random events that affect the decision process.
* <span style="color:blue;"><b>Outcome nodes</b></span>: Illustrated as diamonds, these reflect the resulting utilities or values associated with different decision paths.


The set of edges $$E$$ includes two types of arcs, depending on the type of node they point to:

* **Informational Arcs**. These arcs connect to decision nodes and indicate temporal precedence. In other words, the variable at the origin of the arc represents information that is available and known at the time the decision is made at the destination node.
* **Conditional Arcs**. These arcs connect to value or chance nodes and represent dependencies, either functional or probabilistic, on the values of the parent nodes. They do not imply causality or temporal precedence.
